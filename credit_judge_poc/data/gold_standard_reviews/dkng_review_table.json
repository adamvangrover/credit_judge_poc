    "comments": "The AI's assessment of DraftKings (DKNG) correctly identifies the core tension between rapid growth and the path to profitability. The inferred 'B+' rating with a 'Stable' outlook is a reasonable interpretation of current data. The report covers key financial metrics, though a more forward-looking view on cash burn rate vs. available liquidity would be beneficial. The SNC 'Special Mention' is appropriate.",

The leverage section notes Net Debt and cash appropriately.
