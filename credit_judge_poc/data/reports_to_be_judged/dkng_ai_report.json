  "tickerSymbol": "DKNG",
  "overview": "DraftKings Inc. is a digital sports entertainment and gaming company operating predominantly in the United States. The company has established a strong market presence in online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming through rapid expansion and aggressive marketing. Recent performance indicates robust revenue growth driven by new state openings and increased user adoption. However, achieving sustained profitability and positive free cash flow remains a key challenge amidst a competitive landscape and evolving regulatory environment. The recent acquisition of Jackpocket is a strategic move to diversify into the iLottery market.",

    "rating": "B+",
    "outlook": "Stable",
    "justification": "The 'B+' rating reflects DraftKings' significant revenue scale in the rapidly growing North American online gaming market and improving Adjusted EBITDA margins. The company benefits from a strong brand and a large active user base.

The Stable outlook balances strong top-line momentum and market leadership against the execution risks associated with achieving sustainable profitability and integrating acquisitions.",
