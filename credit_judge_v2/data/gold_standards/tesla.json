    "comments": "The AI report accurately captures Tesla's dominance in EV and its expansion into AI/Robotics. The 'A-' rating is defensible given the balance sheet strength, though the competitive risks in China and margin compression are slightly underplayed. The regulatory section is well-covered.",

    {
      "sectionName": "Corporate Credit Rating",
      "qualitativeFeedback": "The 'A-' Stable rating is appropriate. Justification cites cash reserves and lack of net debt, which is correct. Could have mentioned the volatility of the stock as a factor in capital access, though less relevant for credit.",

      "sectionName": "SNCF Regulatory Rating",
      "qualitativeFeedback": "Pass/Acceptable is the correct classification. Tesla is not an SNC reportable entity in the traditional sense, but the mock rating fits the exercise.",
